In this article, we’ll explore the monumental differences between ChatGPT 3.5 and 4 and witness some mind-blowing prompts and responses that showcase the sheer power of this mighty AI beast.

But first, let’s get our funny bones tickled, shall we? Here’s a ChatGPT 4 joke for you:

> Why don’t scientists trust atoms anymore? Because they make up everything!

Now that we’ve got the giggles going, let’s dive into the AI ocean and explore the wonders of ChatGPT 4!

### Section 1: From ChatGPT 3.5 to 4 — What Changed?

Ah, ChatGPT 3.5, we knew ye well! You were the talk of the town, the belle of the AI ball. But alas, you’ve been dethroned by your younger sibling, ChatGPT 4! Let’s take a stroll down memory lane and reminisce about what set you apart.

#### 1.1 Size Matters — Bigger Models, Better Results

One key difference between ChatGPT 3.5 and 4 is the sheer size of the models. ChatGPT 4 is like the Hulk of AI models, flexing its powerful muscles with a mind-boggling number of parameters! The larger model allows for an even more advanced understanding of context and an increased ability to generate coherent and engaging responses.

#### 1.2 Adaptability — The Chameleon of AI

While ChatGPT 3.5 was no slouch when it came to adapting to different writing styles, ChatGPT 4 takes it up a notch. It’s the AI chameleon, seamlessly shifting from casual banter to formal dissertations and back again. This adaptability makes it an invaluable tool for a wide range of applications — from academic research to creative writing and everything in between.

#### 1.3 Multi-Lingual Maestro

ChatGPT 4’s language capabilities are nothing short of impressive. While ChatGPT 3.5 could handle multiple languages to some extent, ChatGPT 4 is a true polyglot, fluent in a multitude of languages and dialects. Need help with your French homework or translating an ancient Sumerian text? ChatGPT 4 has got you covered!

### Section 2: Showcasing the Power of ChatGPT 4 — Prompts & Responses

In this section, we’ll explore some examples of prompts that were challenging for ChatGPT 3.5 but are now handled perfectly by ChatGPT 4, demonstrating the significant improvements in the new model.

#### 2.1 The Master of Ambiguity

Prompt: What’s the best way to remove it?

(ChatGPT 3.5 struggled with this prompt due to the ambiguity of “it”.)

ChatGPT 4: To provide the best solution for removing “it”, I would need more context about the object or situation you’re referring to. Please provide more details so I can offer an appropriate method of removal.

#### 2.2 The Historical Connoisseur

Prompt: Compare the leadership styles of Julius Caesar and Napoleon Bonaparte.

(ChatGPT 3.5 would often provide generic answers or fail to properly compare the two leaders.)

ChatGPT 4: Julius Caesar and Napoleon Bonaparte were both influential military leaders who left indelible marks on history. Their leadership styles, however, had some key differences.

Julius Caesar was known for his charisma and ability to inspire loyalty in his troops. He often led from the front and shared in the hardships faced by his soldiers, creating a strong bond between them. Caesar’s leadership style was more personal, focusing on building relationships and trust with his men.

Napoleon Bonaparte, on the other hand, was a tactical genius and a master of organization. His leadership style was more systematic and strategic. He made extensive use of meritocracy, promoting officers based on their talents and accomplishments rather than their social background. Napoleon was known for his meticulous planning and attention to detail, which allowed him to adapt quickly to changing circumstances on the battlefield.

In summary, while both Julius Caesar and Napoleon Bonaparte were exceptional leaders, their leadership styles differed in terms of personal connection and strategic approach. Caesar’s charisma and personal touch set him apart, while Napoleon’s strategic acumen and organizational skills were his defining traits.

#### 2.3 The Multi-Lingual Translator

Prompt: Translate the following English sentence into Japanese: “The cherry blossoms are in full bloom.”

(ChatGPT 3.5 had limited success with accurate translations.)

Response: 桜が満開です。 (Sakura ga mankai desu.)

### Section 3: ChatGPT 4’s Mastery of Emotion and Nuance

In this section, we will explore another fascinating aspect of ChatGPT 4: its ability to understand and generate text that conveys emotions and nuances effectively. This improvement over ChatGPT 3.5 allows it to engage in more natural and human-like conversations.

#### 3.1 Empathetic Listener

Prompt: I just lost my job and I’m feeling really down.

Response: I’m so sorry to hear that you’ve lost your job. It’s completely natural to feel down in such a situation. Remember, it’s okay to take some time to process your emotions and regroup. Reach out to your friends and family for support, and consider exploring new opportunities that might come your way. You never know what doors might open during this challenging time.

#### 3.2 The Motivator

Prompt: I’m nervous about my upcoming presentation. Any advice?

Response: It’s completely normal to feel nervous before a presentation. Here are a few tips to help you ace it:

- Practice your presentation several times to build confidence.
- Focus on your breath to help calm your nerves.
- Make eye contact with your audience to establish a connection.
- Use visual aids to support your points and engage your audience.

Lastly, believe in yourself! You’ve got this!

Remember, a little bit of nervousness can actually help keep you on your toes and deliver a more dynamic presentation.

#### 3.3 The Storyteller

Prompt: Tell me a short story about a lonely robot who finds friendship.

Response: Once upon a time, in a world where humans and robots coexisted, there lived a lonely robot named Remy. Remy was an older model, often overlooked by the newer, flashier robots in town.

One day, while wandering the outskirts of the city, Remy stumbled upon a small, abandoned kitten. With a gentle whir, Remy scooped the kitten up and decided to care for it.

As the days went by, a bond formed between the robot and the kitten, whom Remy named Whiskers. They became inseparable, exploring the world together and sharing their experiences. In time, the duo caught the attention of others, and their heartwarming friendship inspired both humans and robots alike.

Through their adventures, Remy and Whiskers showed everyone that true friendship transcends appearances and the boundaries between species. And in the end, Remy was no longer a lonely robot but a cherished friend to Whiskers and many others.
