    A darkblock is a piece of content encrypted by the Darkblock Protocol and stored on Arweave (where it will live for at least 200 years).
    A darkblock is immutably linked to an NFT. Only the creator of the NFT can add a darkblock to it and only the owner of the NFT can access it. NFT creators can add darkblock unlockable content even after the NFT has been sold.`,
